## User Configuration Files

In Linux systems, applications frequently store user-specific configuration files and subdirectories
within a userâ€™s home directory. These configuration files control how applications behave for a specific user and are typically only writable by the users or root.
If we compromise a system under a given user, we can modify those files and change how applications behave for them.

Two common examples are .bash_profile and .bashrc.
